elevator pitch
    Hi, I'm Kyle beavin i'm a software developer. Right now Im actually getting certified in web 
    development and learning javascript. 

        You know I read that 2018 will be a challenging year for recruiters. Unemployments  
        down but employers are hiring more people than they did last year. People also get comfortable
        they stop updating their resumes. Thats why I like to keep learning new things.
        I want to be able to add something to my resume every year.
